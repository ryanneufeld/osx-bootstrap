Ansible For OSX system bootstrap
===================================

Runs on the local host, doesn't need ssh. This makes it faster.

Requires ansible and any local dependencies you may require. (SSH Keys for github, etc). note that bootstrap.sh will install ansible+homebrew for you. 

This is best run on fresh OSX machines.
